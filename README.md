- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Elizabeth Miller
- ðŸ‘€ I am the driving force behind https://bikeadventurous.com/. You can call me the Queen of Two-Wheeler Troubles or simply the Bike Repair Specialist. I once ruled the world of fixing bikes like a boss. But then, my rebellious spirit told me to venture into the wild world of blogging. Now, instead of using tools to fix gears, I use words to entertain and educate my readers (or so I hope). Donâ€™t get me wrong, my love for bikes is still intact, but I found a new love for writing that I canâ€™t seem to stop. <!---
